 <h2 id="orderh" name="orderh">Before You Place an Order</h2>

 <p> Before you place an order please keep the following things in mind.
 </p>

 <h3>Personal Use</h3>
 <p> Unfortunately, due to the cost and time
   involved in shipping and handling, we can only send in bulk. We are
   unable to respond to requests for DVDs for personal use for <em>any
     reason</em> (including your terrible internet connection). To get a DVD image
   for yourself, please visit
   <a href="http://software.opensuse.org">software.opensuse.org</a>.
   And if your internet connection is too slow, contact your
   <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Ambassadors_list">local Ambassador</a>
   for an event in your area where you can get a free copy. By the way, if you
   don't have a local Ambassador, consider becoming one! We'd love to have
   you in our community.
 </p>

 <h3>Commercial Use and Resale</h3>
 <p> These PromoDVDs are not for resale. If you wish to sell openSUSE versions, please
