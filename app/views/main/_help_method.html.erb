BitTorrent downloads have several benefits, the clients protect against data corruption and you help relieving the load on the servers by participating in the upload - if enough people participate it will also be faster than the centralized servers - for everybody. Whatsmore, it allows you to stop the download at any time and resume it later.")%>

    <%=_("<a href=\"http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Metalink\">Metalink</a> is an open standard that bundles the various ways (FTP/HTTP/BitTorrent) to get files into one format for easier downloads. This makes it good for downloading ISOs; particularly for people who can't use P2P because of restrictions from their ISP or University. It can deliver very fast download speeds since most clients support multiple connections, to multiple mirrors, automatically. In addition, it can do automatic error detection, and correction. It needs a special client to handle it though.")%>
