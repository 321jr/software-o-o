Todo list for software.o.o:

Package Search: 
- better display of 'sub-packages' in the result list
- Check if we can get the distroname into our browsers headers so software.o.o can switch automatically to the users distro
- automatically search unsupported packages when nothing found (or always, below other results)
- show current distribution in the headline or so with change option

Package Details: 
- Detect and show 'devel' package
- Defined sort order for unsupported packages
- Connect to ocs api to enable ratings and comments
  https://launchpad.net/rnr-server
- Sort out rpm links with multiple base projects, see multiple 32 bit links for 12.1 on 
  http://software.opensuse.org/package/banshee
  same for factory standard:snapshot, maybe prefer the pseudo standard names like opensuse_12.1
- link to install instructions for non-suse distros (like on software.o.o/download)
- add tooltips for download links including size, build date etc
- add link to ftp repo
- add sitemap.xml page for google


Appstore:
- Pimp up the appstore startpage with featured apps, highest rated... (-> eugene)
- Prepare for multiple appdata backends (once 12.2 comes out)
- Test all pages with different browsers
