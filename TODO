Todo list for software.o.o:

Package Search: 
- better display of 'sub-packages' in the result list
- Check if we can get the distroname into our browsers headers so software.o.o can switch automatically to the users distro
- enable searching for a special project
- Bug: Libreoffice not found when searching for "libreoffice" but when searching for "office"
- Check to replace the searchbar on http://software.opensuse.org/ with the new one, or if we don't need a package search on 
  the dvd download page
- Bug: Fix the statistics page


Package Details: 
- Detect and show 'devel' package
- Defined sort order for unsupported packages
- Cache screenshots from debshots, stay in contact with debshots maintainer to get opensuse distro added
- Connect to ocs api to enable ratings and comments
- Sort out rpm links with multiple base projects, see multiple 32 bit links for 12.1 on 
  http://software.opensuse.org/package/banshee
- link to install instructions for non-suse distros (like on software.o.o/download)
- add tooltips for download links including size, build date etc



Appstore:
- Pimp up the appstore startpage with featured apps, highest rated... 
- Prepare for multiple appdata backends (once 12.2 comes out)
- create images for featured apps like on https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/home
- Test all pages with different browsers
