Todo list for software.o.o:

Package Search: 
- better display of 'sub-packages' in the result list
- Check if we can get the distroname into our browsers headers so software.o.o can switch automatically to the users distro


Package Details: 
- Detect and show 'devel' package
- Defined sort order for unsupported packages
- Cache screenshots from debshots, stay in contact with debshots maintainer to get opensuse distro added
- Connect to ocs api to enable ratings and comments
- Sort out rpm links with multiple base projects, see multiple 32 bit links for 12.1 on 
  http://software.opensuse.org/package/banshee


Appstore:
- Pimp up the appstore startpage with featured apps, highest rated... 
- Prepare for multiple appdata backends (once 12.2 comes out)
